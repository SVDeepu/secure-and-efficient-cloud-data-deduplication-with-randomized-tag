## Secure-and-efficient-cloud-data-deduplication-with-randomized-tag
Cross-client data deduplication has been widely used to eliminate redundant storage overhead in cloud storage system. Recently, Abadi et al. introduced the primitive of MLE2 with nice security properties for secure and efficient data deduplication
## About
The world recently witnessed a massive surveillance program aimed at breakingusers’ privacy. Perpetrators were not hindered by the various security measures deployed within the targeted services. For instance, although these services relied on encryption mechanisms to guarantee data confidentiality, the necessary keying material was acquired by means of backdoors, bribe, or coercion. If the encryption key is exposed, the only viable meansto guarantee confidentiality is to limit the adversary’s access to the ciphertext, e.g., by spreading it across multiple administrative domains
## Features
Anaiyze we consider the server side optimization over our dynamic deduplication decision tree ,since it could gradually collect and record the deduplication access frequency of all the elements stored in the database.

## Result
Interactive avenues are explore to improve the efficiency of fully randomized secure deduplication scheme R-MLE2.To achieve secure and efficient data deduplication ,we construct two interactive schemes based on static and dynamic deduplication decision tree structures ,respectively. The static deduplication decision tree is constructed based on the random elements from the client ,which does not allow the tree to update. However ,the dynamic deduplication decision tree is constructed based on the designed self-generation tree ,which allows the server to conduct tree update and some other optimization. The security ,theoretical and practical performance analysis show that our scheme is path-PRV-CDA2 secure and it achieves several orders of magnitude higher performance than the state-of-the-art schemes in practical data deduplication.
